2022, Homework 2: A* Search</h1>
<h2 id="due-friday-september-30-1159pm">Due: Friday, September 30,
11:59pm</h2>
<h2 id="i.-overview">I. Overview</h2>
<p>In this assignment you will be implementing the A* search algorithm
for solving 3 different search problems - EightPuzzle, WordLadder, and
GridSearch. Your single implementation of the algorithm will work for
all 3 problems, by properly instantiating an AbstractState class for
each of them. You will see both the power of A* as an algorithm that
applies to arbitrary discrete state spaces, and the power of heuristics
to speed up search.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-getting-started">II. Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started on this assignment, download the <a href="https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs440/fa2022/MPs/mp2/template.zip">template code</a>. The template contains the following
files and directories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>search.py</code>. You will edit and submit this - your
implementation of A* goes here.</p></li>
<li><p><code>state.py</code>. You will edit and submit this - your
implementation of each problem’s State goes here.</p></li>
<li><p><code>utils.py</code>. Some utilities we provide.</p></li>
<li><p><code>maze.py</code>. Some utilities for reading and working with
grid mazes.</p></li>
<li><p><code>main.py</code>. You will run this file to test your
code.</p></li>
<li><p><code>data/eight_puzzle</code>. Text files containing example
problems for the eight puzzle task</p></li>
<li><p><code>data/word_ladder</code>. Text file containing example
problems for the word ladder task, along with a dictionary of english
words</p></li>
<li><p><code>data/mazes</code>. Files containing example mazes to
solve</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please ONLY submit <code>search.py</code> and
<code>state.py</code>.</p>
<p>For each of the remaining parts of the assignment you will find TODOs
in <code>search.py</code> and <code>state.py</code> where you need to
write your own code. For example, for part III you will find TODOs
marked <code># TODO(III)</code>. We’ve provided many comments and
instructions in the code under those TODOs.</p>
<h2 id="iii.-implementing-best-first-search-and-wordladder">III.
Implementing Best First Search (and WordLadder)</h2>
<figure align="center">
<img src="./mp2_files/head_to_tail_word_ladder.png" width="400" height="400">
<figcaption align="center">
<b>WordLadder: find a sequence of English words from some starting word
(i.e., “head”) to some goal word (i.e., “tail”), where consecutive words
differ by only one letter</b>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are 2 “TODO(III)” in <code>search.py</code>.</p>
<p>Your first task is to implement a generic best first search algorithm
in the method <code>best_first_search(starting_state)</code> in
<code>search.py</code>. Your implementation should:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a priority queue (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html">heapq</a>) of states
on the “frontier”</li>
<li>use a dictionary that keeps track of the states which have been
visited</li>
<li>iteratively search through the neighbors of each state until you
find the shortest path to the goal</li>
<li>if you do not find the goal you should return an empty list</li>
</ul>
<!-- - iteratively:
    - pop the first element from this frontier
    - check if the popped element is the goal of the search
        - if yes, the search should terminate and return the final path (through backtracking)
    - if no, add neighbors of the popped element to the frontier
        - do not add a neighbor if they have been visited before using a shorter path -->
<p>Notice that the input to <code>best_first_search</code> is just a
starting state. You may be wondering:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you find the neighbors of a state?</li>
<li>How do you know if you’ve reached the goal?</li>
<li>How can you hash state objects into a dictionary?</li>
<li>How can you push state objects onto a sorted heap?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you should look at <code>state.py</code>, there are 3 “TODO(III)”
in <code>state.py</code>. These questions should be answered by the
comments in the code under those TODOs. You should first read through
our <code>AbstractState</code> class, then look at an instantiation of
this class called <code>WordLadderState</code>.</p>
<p>In order to test your search code we’ve provided almost all of
<code>WordLadderState</code>. Once you’ve filled in the missing code,
and implemented the search code, you should be able to test your
algorithm. Make sure your algorithm works on all the provided tests
before moving on to the next parts. If it works you will not have to
touch it again!</p>
<p>Run best_first_search on all WordLadder problems:</p>
<pre><code>python3 main.py --problem_type=WordLadder </code></pre>
<h2 id="iv.-eightpuzzle">IV. EightPuzzle</h2>
<figure align="center">
<img src="./mp2_files/8_puzzle.png" width="800" height="400">
<figcaption align="center">
<b>EightPuzzle: find a sequence of tile moves that put each number in
its final position (right) from some example starting position (left).
You can only move a tile that is adjacent to the empty square into the
empty square.</b>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now move on to EightPuzzleState, we’ve provided some but not all of
the code you’ll need here. There are 4 “TODO(IV)” in
<code>state.py</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement <code>manhattan(a,b)</code>
<ul>
<li>you will need this for computing the heuristic, you will also need
this for parts V and VI</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement <code>EightPuzzleState.get_neighbors(self)</code>
<ul>
<li>In EightPuzzle the possible actions are to move an adjacent tile
into the empty square (indicated by a zero)</li>
<li>There are up to 4 possible neighbors for each state, though if the
empty tile is on the edge there are fewer</li>
<li>The order you add states onto the frontier matters for tiebreaking
<ul>
<li>You should add them in the order [below, left, above, right], where
for example “below” corresponds to moving the empty tile down (moving
the tile below the empty tile up). See the figure below for
details.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement <code>EightPuzzleState.compute_heuristic(self)</code>
<ul>
<li>There is more than one valid heuristic for this problem, the one we
ask you to implement is Manhattan
<ul>
<li>Manhattan heuristic for Eight Puzzle is the sum of the manhattan
distances from each tile to its goal location (not counting the empty
tile)</li>
<li>This is a valid heuristic because each tile must move at least its
manhattan distance times to reach its goal, and you can only move one
tile at a time.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implement <code>EightPuzzleState.__lt__(self, other)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Run best_first_search on EightPuzzle problems (all puzzles with
puzzle_len=N can be solved in N steps):</p>
<pre><code>python3 main.py --problem_type=EightPuzzle --puzzle_len=5 </code></pre>
<p>You can choose any puzzle length among [5, 10, 27].</p>
<figure align="center">
<img src="./mp2_files/8_puzzle_move_order.png" width="400" height="400">
<figcaption align="center">
<b>Please add neighbors in this move order (a,b,c,d) to be consistent
with our implementation. The manhattan heuristic for this example is: 3
(number of moves 1 is away from its goal location) + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 +
3 + 2 (number of moves 8 is away from its goal location) = 18. This
means this puzzle takes at least 18 moves to solve. </b>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="v.-single-goal-grid-search">V. Single Goal Grid Search</h2>
<figure align="center">
<img src="./mp2_files/grid_search_single.png" width="600" height="300">
<figcaption align="center">
<b>In grid search we find a path through a 2D maze from some starting
location to a single goal location. Each state is a discrete (x,y)
location in the maze, and the goal is an additional location in the
maze. From any location you can transition to a neighboring location
assuming there is no obstacle there (colored black). In the
visualization above green indicates the end of the path and red
indicates the beginning. </b>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Finally we come to GridSearch.</p>
<p>Run the following to see mazes and navigate them yourself with the
arrow keys:</p>
<pre><code>python3 main.py --problem_type=GridSingle --human --maze_file=[path_to_maze_file in data/mazes/grid_single] </code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>note</strong>: if the red-green gradient is hard for you to
see, you can make the visualization use an alternative color scheme by
specifying the <code>--altcolor</code> option</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you will need to implement the <code>SingleGoalGridState</code>
class. If you would like to see how the maze is built navigate to
<code>maze.py</code>, but otherwise we’ve provided you everything you
need and instructions in <code>state.py</code> where you have 4
“TODO(V)” to complete. The heuristic we use for grid search is the
manhattan distance from the current location to the goal.</p>
<p>You can test your code with:</p>
<pre><code>python3 main.py --problem_type=GridSingle --maze_file=[path_to_maze_file in data/mazes/grid_single] </code></pre>
<p>If you would like to also visualize the resulting solution in PyGame
add the <code>--show_maze_vis</code> flag.</p>
<h2 id="vi.-multi-goal-grid-search">VI. Multi Goal Grid Search</h2>
<figure align="center">
<img src="./mp2_files/grid_multi_maze.png" width="800" height="300">
<figcaption align="center">
<b>Now we consider grid search problems with multiple goals that can be
reached in any order</b>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We now generalize single goal grid search to multi goal grid search.
There are 5 “TODO(VI)” for you to complete in <code>state.py</code>.</p>
<p>Multiple goals requires a new heuristic. The one we use is the
Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). Specifically, given a state and a set of
goals, the heuristic cost for visiting all the goals is computed as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treat the set of goals as nodes in a complete graph</li>
<li>The edge weights on this graph are the distances between the goals
(or approximate distances using manhattan)</li>
<li>To solve the multi goal search problem (i.e., a version of the
Travelling Salesman Problem) we must travel AT LEAST the cost of the MST
of this graph</li>
<li>In addition to the cost of the MST we also need to reach the first
goal, therefore our final heuristic is:
<ul>
<li>h(state, goals) = manhattan(state, closest_goal) + MST(goals)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>We provide you with most of the code you need to compute this MST
heuristic, you can call
<code>compute_mst_cost(self.goal, manhattan)</code> to compute the cost
of the minimum spanning tree for a set of goals. <strong>Note that
because computing the mst takes some time, you should store the computed
mst values in the cache we provide you.</strong></p>
<p>You can test your code with:</p>
<pre><code>python3 main.py --problem_type=GridMulti --maze_file=[path_to_maze_file in data/mazes/grid_multi]</code></pre>
<p>You can also check backwards compatibility by running GridMulti on a
maze file with only one goal.</p>
